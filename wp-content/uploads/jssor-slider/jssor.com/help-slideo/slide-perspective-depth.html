<span class="jd-tooltip-title">Depth</span> [Optional]<br />
Depth of perspective (3d) view, to enable 3d view of a slide, this option should be specified.<br />
for example, 0.25 means 25% of slide size. Given a slide with size 600px x 400px, the perspective is (600 + 400) / 2 * 0.25 = 250px.<br />
<br />
This option affects appearance of layer applied with 'Rotate X' or 'Rotate Y' or 'Translate Z' effect.

<br />
<br />
<span class="text-warning">Note that there is minor issue of a few browsers with 3d perspective view. But 3d transition of 'Rotate X', 'Rotate Y' and 'Translate Z' are safe for individual layer even without 3d perspective view.</span>
